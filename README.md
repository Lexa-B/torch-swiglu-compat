# torch-swiglu-compat
A small compatability patch to add in fmo-mt's style of SwiGLU into PyTorch's nn while we're waiting for the actual PR to be merged. Most of the functional code is based on fmo-mt' work, so I don't make any claim to copyright over any of it. This is just a temporary solution and I'll take it down once the full SwiGLU support is added to Torch.
